[2018-08-20 20:30:41] log.INFO: New order:  [{"id":"2","name":"Cheshire","description":" The Cheshire Cat was undoubtedly a British Shorthair. These smiling cats enjoy attention, are normally quiet, but occasionally have bursts of crazed activity before changing back into your affectionate, dignified friend. They get along with children and cat-friendly dogs.\n\nBritish Shorthairs are calm and undemanding. Males are big, easy lugs with a happy-go-lucky nature but a natural air of command. Females are more serious. Both want only to be with their people, not necessarily in a lap or being carried around, but next to them or in the same room with them. When you’re not home, they are satisfied to entertain themselves until you return. ","price":1400,"count":2,"price_one":"700"},{"id":"3","name":"Persian","description":"The dignified and docile Persian is known for being quiet and sweet. She is an ornament to any home where she can enjoy sitting in a lap—surely her rightful place—being petted by those who are discerning enough to recognize her superior qualities, and playing house with kind children who will gently comb her hair, wheel her around in a baby buggy, then serve her tea at their parties. Persians are affectionate but discriminating. They reserve their attention for family members and those few guests whom they feel they can trust","price":"300","count":1,"price_one":"300"},{"id":"1","name":"Siamese","description":"Siamese cats crave attention and affection from their humans and like to stay close by particularly one family member. They are intelligent and inquisitive cats that have such striking voices and body movements that they are referred to as the most talkative cat breed.\n\nGreat with children and other pets, Siamese cats can be demanding and leery of strangers. Many people have said that their Siamese cats greet strangers at the door and perform a sort of approval process before the visitors enter the home.\n\nThis is an active cat who needs stimulation or lots of toys to keep occupied. Siamese cats are people-oriented and do not like being left alone for extended periods of time. If you work long hours, consider getting 2 Siamese cats so they can entertain each other when you’re gone. Rest assured they will fill you in on the day’s events when you arrive home.","price":"500","count":1,"price_one":"500"}] []
